=======

Please note that autochaos is only required if you want to modify the
build process; for example, adding new files, removing files,
etcetera. Thus, many people will not need it. Of course, having it
never hurts, and you never know when you will find some use for
it. :-)

It uses the following non-standard Perl module:

  XML::Simple

It can all be found at CPAN (http://www.cpan.org), the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network. For more information about this, see the above
mentioned URL.
